#jsontodb
###Json - to - Database

This simple web app to insert json file data to MongoDB or Create MySQL query.

What I used : 

    nodejs 
      Yeoman generator
      express framework
      multer middleware to upload files in nodejs
    Gulp 
    Bower
    Bootstrap

Using this we can easily browse and upload json file, then give relevent details about database. Then you get generated code to make database.

When you want this kind of thing.

  * If you have excel sheet or somedata sheet. You can easily these datasheets to Json data file.(there are so many free websites to convert file) Then we can easily enter these data to MongoDB or MySQL database. [I think MongoDB is the best way.]
